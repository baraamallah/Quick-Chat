# New Features - Friend Code & Session Management

## Overview
Two major features have been added to the Settings page to give users more control over their account and connections.

---

## 1. Editable Friend Code 🔑

### What It Does
Users can now customize their friend code instead of being stuck with the randomly generated one.

### Features
- **6-character code**: Must be exactly 6 characters (letters and numbers only)
- **Uniqueness check**: System validates that the code isn't already taken
- **Uppercase conversion**: Automatically converts to uppercase for consistency
- **Real-time validation**: Shows character count and validates format

### How to Use
1. Go to Settings page
2. Find the "Friend Code" field in the Profile section
3. Enter your desired 6-character code (e.g., "COOL99", "GAMER1")
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. System will check if the code is available
6. Your new friend code will be updated

### Validation Rules
- ✅ Exactly 6 characters
- ✅ Letters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9) only
- ✅ Must be unique across all users
- ❌ No special characters or spaces
- ❌ Cannot be less than or more than 6 characters

### Error Messages
- "Friend code must be exactly 6 characters (letters and numbers)"
- "Friend code already taken"

## 2. Close Session Feature 🔥

### What It Does
Allows users to completely reset their social connections and messages while keeping their account intact. Think of it as a "fresh start" button.

### What Gets Deleted
- ✅ **All friendships** - Every friend connection is removed
- ✅ **All messages** - Every message sent or received is permanently deleted
- ✅ **All chat history** - Complete conversation history is wiped

### What Stays
- ✅ Your account and login credentials
- ✅ Your profile settings (display name, username, bio, avatar, color)
- ✅ Your friend code
- ✅ Your email and authentication

### How to Use
1. Go to Settings page
2. Scroll to the "Danger Zone" section
3. Click "🔥 Close Session" button
4. Confirm the first warning dialog
5. Confirm the second warning dialog
6. Enter your username to verify
7. System will delete all friends and messages
8. Page reloads with a clean slate

### Safety Features
- **Double confirmation**: Two warning dialogs before proceeding
- **Username verification**: Must type exact username to confirm
- **Clear warnings**: Explains exactly what will be deleted
- **No accidental clicks**: Multiple steps prevent mistakes

### Use Cases
- Starting fresh with new friends
- Clearing old conversations

## Technical Details

### Friend Code Implementation
```javascript
// Validation
if (!/^[A-Z0-9]{6}$/.test(friendCode)) {
    showNotification('Friend code must be exactly 6 characters');
}

// Uniqueness check
const { data: existingCode } = await supabaseClient
    .from('users')
    .select('id')
    .eq('friend_code', friendCode)
    .single();
```

### Close Session Implementation
```javascript
// Delete all messages
await supabaseClient
    .from('messages')
    .delete()
    .or(`sender_id.eq.${userId},receiver_id.eq.${userId}`);

// Delete all friendships
await supabaseClient
    .from('friendships')
    .delete()
    .or(`user1_id.eq.${userId},user2_id.eq.${userId}`);
```

## Security Considerations

### Friend Code
- Unique constraint enforced at database level
- Case-insensitive storage (all uppercase)
- Cannot be blank or invalid format
- Checked for duplicates before saving

### Close Session
- Requires username confirmation
- Two-step confirmation process
- Only deletes user's own data
- Respects database relationships
- Maintains data integrity
